# Manual Testing
## Responsiveness
### User Stories Tested:
| AS A/AN     | I WANT TO BE ABLE TO ... | SO THAT I CAN... | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Site User/ Shopper | access the website with any devices | Use the website anytime and anywhere |
### Test conducted:
- Access each page in the site with different screen sizes by Google Dev Tool's Emulator and check the layout and format of site elements
### Result:
1. Navbar: I have the search bar to be collapsed for smaller than medium screen size (width < 992px) because search Bar with input field conflicted with other navbar components. 
'My Account' pulldown list is included to toggle menu for smaller than medium screen size.
2. Home page: The image size responsiveness on Carousel at landing(home) page was adjusted by media queries.
### Verdict:
The bug is fixed. Test passed.
